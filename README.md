# Medieval Quest Log (To-Do List)

> *Determine your destiny, one scroll at a time.*

A fully immersive, medieval-themed To-Do List application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features interactive parchment scrolls, dramatic fire animations, and a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile.

## Features

### 📜 Interactive Quest Scrolls
-   **Draggable**: Move your quests (scrolls) freely around the board.

-   **Persistent**: All quests and their positions are saved automatically to `localStorage`.

### 🔥 Dramatic Interactions

-   **Rubbish Bin**: Drag completed quests to the bin, or click the tick button to see them crumple and fly away.

### 🎨 Immersive Design
